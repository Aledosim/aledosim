# Hi there!
My name is Alexandre do Sim, I'm a physics teacher from Brazil that like GNU/Linux (I use [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/)). I did some bootcamps on [Digital Innovation One](https://web.digitalinnovation.one), studied about data science but my main interest is in software quality. Currently I'm a [CTFL certificated software tester](https://astqb.org/certifications/foundation-level-certification/). My second insterest is in front end development.

A few years ago I graduated in a technical course of audio and video production, since then I did a feel audio works. For now this is my hobbie.



# Main projects
All these projects followed the principles of Test Driven Development. Except for BitInforma, in which I wrote most tests later (because I was learning how to do it), and Mover.

* [qute-snippets](https://github.com/Aledosim/qute-snippets): a python script for [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) which lets the user associate a text with a given keyword and retrieve it later. 

* [Cryptocurrencies Max Min](https://github.com/Aledosim/CryptocurrenciesMaxMin): an analisys of cryptocurrencies prices based on their maximum valuation and devaluation. For this I used pandas and matplotlib within Jupyter. The work is in portuguese.

* [Short Listen](https://github.com/Aledosim/short-listen): a single page application that shows the most played musics of Deezer and have a list of user's favorite songs. Developed with ReactJS.

* [BitInforma](https://github.com/Aledosim/bitinforma): a landpage to follow cryptocurrencies with a search field to look for different currencies. Developed with ReactJS.

* [AdReg](https://github.com/Aledosim/adreg): a social media advertisement database with a impact prediction system. Writen in python with pytest.
